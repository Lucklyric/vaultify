## Installation

### Via npm (recommended)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @lucklyric/vaultify

# Or with yarn
yarn global add @lucklyric/vaultify

# Or run directly with npx
npx @lucklyric/vaultify
```

### Pre-built binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/Lucklyric/vaultify/releases).

### From source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lucklyric/vaultify.git
cd vaultify

# Build with Rust
cargo build --release

# Binary will be at target/release/vaultify
```

## Quick Start

### Initialize a vault

```bash
vaultify init
```

This creates a `vault.toml` file in the current directory.

### Add a secret

```bash
# Will open your system editor for secure input
vaultify add personal/email/gmail -d "Personal Gmail account"

# From stdin
echo "my-secret-password" | vaultify add personal/email/gmail --stdin -d "Personal Gmail"
```

### List entries

```bash
# Simple list
vaultify list

# Tree view
vaultify list --tree

# Filter by scope
vaultify list personal/email
```

### Decrypt a secret

```bash
# Interactive mode - choose display format after entering password
vaultify decrypt personal/email/gmail

# Show in terminal directly
vaultify decrypt personal/email/gmail --show

# Direct to clipboard (auto-clears after 60 seconds)
vaultify decrypt personal/email/gmail --no-display --clipboard
```

### Edit an entry

```bash
vaultify edit personal/email/gmail
```

### Delete an entry

```bash
vaultify delete personal/email/gmail
```

### GPG Encryption

```bash
# Encrypt entire vault with GPG
vaultify gpg-encrypt --recipient user@example.com

# Decrypt GPG-encrypted vault
vaultify gpg-decrypt
```

### Interactive mode

Run `vaultify` without any arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
vaultify

vaultify> help
vaultify> list
vaultify> add work/vpn
vaultify> decrypt work/vpn
vaultify> exit
```

## Vault Format

Vaults are stored as TOML files with encrypted content:

```toml
version = "v0.3"
modified = "2025-01-17T10:00:00Z"

[personal]
description = "Personal accounts"
encrypted = ""
salt = ""

[personal.email]
description = "Email accounts"
encrypted = "base64-encoded-encrypted-content"
salt = "base64-encoded-salt"
```

### Key Features:
- **Insertion order preserved**: Entries maintain their original order
- **Smart group insertion**: New entries are added at the end of their group
- **Native TOML format**: Clean, readable structure with dotted key notation
- **Flexible parsing**: Parent entries are created automatically

## Security

- **Encryption**: Each entry is encrypted with Argon2id + AES-256-GCM
- **Per-item salts**: Every entry has its own salt for enhanced security
- **Memory safety**: Written in Rust with automatic memory zeroing
- **No password storage**: Password required for every operation
- **Secure permissions**: Vault files are created with 600 permissions

### Encryption Details

- **Key Derivation**: Argon2id with 64MB memory, 2 iterations
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with 96-bit nonces
- **Salt**: 128-bit per-item random salts
- **Authentication**: GCM provides authenticated encryption

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `VAULT_FILE`: Default vault file path
- `EDITOR` or `VISUAL`: System editor for secret input (defaults: notepad on Windows, vi on Unix)

### File Permissions

On Unix systems, vault files are automatically created with 600 permissions (read/write for owner only).

## Development

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Testing

```bash
cargo test
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy
```
